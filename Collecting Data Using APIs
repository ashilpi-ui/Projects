# Jobs Data API Analysis

This project accesses a public Jobs API to analyze job postings data.  
It determines the number of job openings for various technologies and programming languages across U.S. locations.

## Key Steps
- Access JSON data from a REST API.
- Process data using Pandas.
- Count job postings by technology and by location.
- Export results to Excel files (`job-postings.xlsx` and `language-job-postings.xlsx`).

## Files
- `Jobs_Data_API_Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook
- `job-postings.xlsx` — Job counts for key technologies
- `language-job-postings.xlsx` — Job counts for programming languages and databases
